# Initializer architecture

`database-schema` owns the executable Neo4j and PostgreSQL definitions, their compatibility
contract, and the one-shot initializer image. Deployment owns credentials, service ordering,
resource policy, and the released image digest. Schema implementation files do not move into
deployment.

## Execution flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    E[database-schema entrypoint] --> P[Parse PostgreSQL endpoint]
    P --> D{Target database exists?}
    D -->|no| C[Create database through postgres admin database]
    D -->|yes| R[Database ready]
    C --> R
    R --> F[Run schema families concurrently]
    F --> PG[Apply PostgreSQL tables and indexes]
    F --> N[Verify Neo4j and apply constraints and indexes]
    PG --> G{Both succeeded?}
    N --> G
    G -->|yes| Z[Exit 0]
    G -->|no| X[Exit 1]
    Z --> S[Deployment may start dependent services]
```

The PostgreSQL administrative connection has a bounded connection timeout. Each schema
statement is idempotent, and a partial statement failure is still fatal to the initializer.
The Neo4j path verifies connectivity before applying definitions. Both clients are closed on
success or failure.

## Health and failure contract

The image intentionally has no listening port or Docker health check. Its process exit status
is the health contract: zero means the target database exists and both schema families were
applied; any administrative connection, connectivity, or schema failure returns nonzero.
Deployment may retry or stop the rollout, but it must not reinterpret a failed initializer as
healthy.

The image runs as numeric user and group `1000:1000`, writes optional logs under `/logs`, and
is named `ghcr.io/groovemap-music/database-schema` when released.

## Neo4j media schema

ADR 0007 introduces a canonical media taxonomy. Neo4j gains two supporting node types
alongside the existing Artist, Label, Master, Release, Genre, Style, User, and Person nodes:

- `Medium` — one canonical medium (for example `vinyl_lp`), unique on `id`, with `family` and
  `label` properties.
- `MediaFamily` — one of the closed set of media families (for example `vinyl`), unique on
  `name`.

Two relationships connect them into the existing graph:

- `(:Medium)-[:IN_FAMILY]->(:MediaFamily)` — the medium's family.
- `(:Release)-[:ISSUED_ON {qty, source}]->(:Medium)` — the media a release was issued on.
  `qty` is the unit count for that medium on that release (Discogs `qty`, or `1` per
  MusicBrainz medium); `source` names the producer that asserted the edge (`discogs` or
  `musicbrainz`), so a release known to both catalogs can carry both catalogs' media and the
  API can reconcile disagreements between them.

`Release` also carries a `media_families` list property — the sorted, unique family names
present on that release — so consumers can filter by family without traversing `ISSUED_ON`
edges. See `SCHEMA_STATEMENTS` in `src/groovemap_schema/neo4j.py` for the backing
constraints and index.
